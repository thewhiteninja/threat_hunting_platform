I'm working on a threat hunting platform.

- Generate a collector (customizable, automatic upload, fully encrypted)
- Collect data on the target machine (ntfs mft, processes, browser history, prefetch, devices, softwares, os, ...)
- Upload the report (analysis is automatic with more than 100 detections implemented)
- Check the results!

Check the screenshots (wip)

Comments and suggestions are welcome!
